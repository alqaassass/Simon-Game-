# Simon-Game
#### Simon Game is a memory-based game I built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Itâ€™s inspired by the classic 1978 electronic game, and designed to challenge players to recall and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. I started by creating a responsive game board with four color-coded panels and then implemented the core game logic using JavaScript, including randomized sequences, user input tracking, and game state validation. I also added visual effects and transitions to enhance the interactive experience, making the game both engaging and mobile-friendly.

# Planning Process
* Needed a 2x2 squares, each one of them for each color 
* Each square should have a unique color
* Each square should have a unique sound when clicked
* The game should start with a random sequence of colors
* The user should be able to input a sequence of colors
* The game should validate the user's input and provide feedback
* The game should keep track of the user's score and display it on the screen

# Unsolved Problems
The main problem that I faced is with the display method, I tryed many ways to solve it but I did't know what to do with it, the logic is there and it seems easy but I can't figure it out. :(
# Winner
There's no winner in this game, the game should only keep pushing to the sequence.
